    <h1>Comments in HTML</h1>
    <p>In HTML, comments are used to add explanatory notes or annotations within the code that are not displayed in the web browser. They are helpful for developers to document their code, make it more readable, and provide context to others who may work on the code later. Comments are ignored by the browser and do not affect the rendering of the webpage. Everything between <!-- and --> is considered a comment and is not interpreted as HTML code by the browser. You can place comments anywhere within your HTML document.</p>
